- powerbi desktop
  • home - clipboard, extract/collect/get data,   transform <-> act as power query editor,   visual/text
  • insert - visual, power platform apps, 
  • modelling - relationship, calc, para
  • optimize - optimi presets, performance analyzer, slicers

  • Right view - data, visual, filter
  • Left view - data, visual/report, modelling

- power query editor - after loading daatset -> load (or) transform -> For transaform -> use power query editor 
  • after loading daatset -> load (or) transform -> For transaform -> use power query editor 
  • power query editor -> transform data


ROJECT STEPS & ETL ON DATASET
--------------------------------
1. Undertand req & take out important information
2. Consider & Find (kpi/metrices) before making dashboard 
3. Get data sources - csv format
4.1 ETL on Dataset - Data Modelling (relationships) , Data View (ETL step) , Report View (creare visual dashboard)
4.2 Data Modelling (relationships)
4.3 Data View - Power Query Editor 
	(E) - Extract/Collect/Import data sources
	(T) - Data Cleaning - handle/remove duplicates, missing vlaues(spaces/empty/blank), Replace values(null/#NA/error/valuesnull)
	(T) - Transform/Manipulate/Processing dataset - Transformation using power query editor
	(T) - DAX Query, DAX Data Analysis, Calculation & measure 
4.4 Report View 
	* (L) - load & create & format visual charts/dashboard 
	* (L) - create & format visual dashboard - Charts Maps, Filter/Flicers,Create New Columns and Tables)

PROJECT LEARNING
-----------------------
• HOw to approch probelem & perfomer ETL steps on datasets 

• Created interactive dashboard for to analyze emplyee attrition by comparing all parameters
• Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicers 
• Created connections, join new tables, calculations to manipulate data and enable user driven parameters for visualizations
• Used different types of customized visualization (bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, area chart, map, slicers, etc)

• Found KPI's, metrices, key-influencers, trends & patterns
	• For 2 years(2019 & 2020), Overall Emplyee/Employee Count = 1470, Attrition(who left) = 238, Attrition Rate = 16.2%, Average Age(who left) = 37, Average Salary(who left) = 65K, Average Years At Company(who left) = 7
	• Attrition(who left) vs Education, Maximum people was from life Science(37%) & Minimum people was from Human Resources(3%), This means, Sales jobrole department people are happy & laboratory technician jobrole Departmemt people are unhappy & left organiation
	• Attrition(who left) vs JobRole, Maximum people was from Laboratoy Technician(62) & Minimum people was from Slaes(33), This means, HR department people are happy & life scince are unhappy & left organiation
	• Attrition(who left) vs Salary, Maximum peoplewho has 5k salary & Minimum people who fall under 30K salary. This means, people who are 30K above salry are happy & below 5k are unhappy & left organisation
	• Attrition(who left) vs AVG AGE GROUP , Maximum people who has 26-35 age group & Minimum people who has 55+ age group . This means people having age 55+ are happy with job & 26-35 are unhappy due to salary & dept & left job
	• Attrition(who left) vs Years in comapony,  Maximum people stayed 2 years & Minimum people stayed 6 months. This means people are are happy who stayed more than 2+ year bcause of good salary/pay & passionate about work in thier department.
