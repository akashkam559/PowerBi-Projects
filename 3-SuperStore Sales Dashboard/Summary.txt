PROJECT ECOCSYSTEM
------------------------------
- powerbi desktop
  • home - clipboard, extract/collect/get data,   transform <-> act as power query editor,   visual/text
  • insert - visual, power platform apps, 
  • modelling - relationship, calc, para
  • optimize - optimi presets, performance analyzer, slicers

  • Right view - data, visual, filter
  • Left view - data, visual/report, modelling

- power query editor - after loading daatset -> load (or) transform -> For transaform -> use power query editor 
  • after loading daatset -> load (or) transform -> For transaform -> use power query editor 
  • power query editor -> transform data


PROJECT STEPS & ETL ON DATASET
--------------------------------
1. Undertand req & take out important information
2. Consider & Find (kpi/metrices) before making dashboard 
3. Get data sources - csv format
4.1 ETL on Dataset - Data Modelling (relationships) , Data View (ETL step) , Report View (creare visual dashboard)
4.2 Data Modelling (relationships)
4.3 Data View - Power Query Editor 
	(E) - Extract/Collect/Import data sources
	(T) - Data Cleaning - handle/remove duplicates, missing vlaues(spaces/empty/blank), Replace values(null/#NA/error/valuesnull)
	(T) - Transform/Manipulate/Processing dataset - Transformation using power query editor
	(T) - DAX Query, DAX Data Analysis, Calculation & measure 
4.4 Report View 
	* (L) - load & create & format visual charts/dashboard 
	* (L) - create & format visual dashboard - Charts Maps, Filter/Flicers,Create New Columns and Tables)
